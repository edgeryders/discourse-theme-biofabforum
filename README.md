# README

A Discourse (discourse.org) remote theme, made for biofabforum.org.

There are [instructions](https://edgeryders.eu/t/7) for creating and adapting a Discourse remote theme. They also cover (or will cover) the special features added to this remote theme that enable "whitelabel hosting". This means, a part of the content of a Discourse platform is additionally shown on a client-owned domain, with a different theme.
